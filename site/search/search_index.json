All the severity levels &amp; types are listed and you can easily see the error code &amp; try and fix it! You can also contact me, @phoenixthedev_, on Discord so I can further assist you depending on what it is.</p> <p>I also have some quick tips for you for you to take action based on severity!</p> <ul> <li> <p>Low, If anything has a severity level of low, it means that the player won't be affected in gameplay, however if you notice it is happening in a large scale, you may want to investigate further to see if it is truly impacting user experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Medium, The player might be affected, but will be a minor impact e.g Button Animation not working</p> </li> <li> <p>High, The player's gameplay experience will be impacted, this is where you should start investigating ASAP if players are getting the issue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Critical, The player's gameplay will be heavily impacted, e.g a Plot will not be able to function or their data was wiped. </p> </li> </ul> <p>My advice? Anything above High prioritise the most, and anything medium or low, only investigate if it's happening at a large scale. But you should always investigate if you have time, the advice given is just a hierarchy of importance.</p> <p>If anything has a severity level of low, it means that the player won't be affected in gameplay, anyhow, here's the table!</p> Code Type Personal Message Severity B301 Button An error occurred whilst getting the data Button Purchase, this may be due to an error whilst initializing ComplieButtonDataService or the user is attempting a DoS attack (Exploiter).
