Thanks for purchasing my Tycoon Framework! In these documentations, I aim to help you iron out any issues you have. Wherever it may be a setup question, general questions or helping to fix your errors, these documentations should help you get instant access to support!

However, I don't want you to feel ignored, so these guides are aimed to be as friendly & helpful, and not be confusing or time consuming (see the rhyme I did there?)

If these documentations don't help you, feel free to just DM me (@phoenixthedev_) and I'll answer your questions there! 

For easy support, there is a search bar which you can use to quickly navigate the documentation.

## Next Steps

If this is your first time, go to the [Setup Documentation](setup.md).

If you want to see usage on API & Settings, feel free to head over to the [API Documentation](api.md).

If you want to browse error messages, go to [Error Codes Documentation](error_codes.md).
